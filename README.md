Bamazon Marketplace

In this repository, I have created Bamazon; an Amazon-like digital marketplace for users.
In order to effectively run this program, a user will need to perform an npm install for "mysql" and "inquirer". One the user has the files up and has install the appropriate software, they will be able to enter my Bamazon store. This is setup for two different user views: customer and manager.By utilizing the "node" + "bamazoncustomer.js" in the command line, the user will be taken through the marketplace and able to buy different items at different quantities. Similarly, when utilizing "node" + "bamazonManager.js" in the command line, as user (acting as a store manager), is offered additional, more in-depth choices regarding the store.

This project involved the usage of mysql and Node.js.

Welcome to my store! Enjoy!
